                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>HelpNow is imagined as an alternative to 911 for people experiencing homelessness and food shortage issues. It allows individuals to locate assistance in Charlotte, NC. From homeless shelters and soup kitchens to pet care and healthcare,
                    HelpNow can be used to search, find, and navigate countless resources in the city. </p>
                <p class="indent"></p>
                <p>This is a graduate school project for the class Human-Centered Design. The app focuses on achieving a stellar UI and seamless user experience.

                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p> “Apps for homeless people” might sound a bit weird. But cheap smartphones, outreach programs, and youth homelessness mean that many people have a phone but no home. (As of 2011, almost two thirds of homeless youth owned a cell phone.)
                        And in several cities, they can use mobile apps to find food, shelter, and other resources.</p>
                    <p class="indent"></p>
                    <p>A running theme in the news coverage of apps for Social Welfare is that they’re underused, and our preliminary research showed that it is because of poor User Experience. (Many apps never even get past the institutional resistance
                        and regulation.) Instead, people keep calling already overloaded city services, or even the police. So considering all the factors, the overall objective of our application is to help homeless, displaced, and in-need individuals
                        find shelter and food services efficiently and effectively.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p> After deciding on our design topic, our first step was to start doing some research.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We interviewed stakeholders on all sides of the issue, from homeless individuals to shelter managers and policy shapers in oversight organizations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also conducted a literature review of peer reviewed academic journals, newspaper articles, radio broadcast transcripts, and articles found online in order to gain background knowledge on issues surrounding homelessness, technology use, and shelter
                            finding experiences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We rounded out the research with a survey of 22 homeless individuals who we encountered on the streets and in homeless shelters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                <p>Our App focuses on the features intended for our primary user base, people in need of food and/or shelter. The design goals for the prototype include:</p>
                <p class="indent"></p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Helping people in need efficiently find food and shelter services information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developing a simple and easy-to-use interface that allows users to discover what’s available in their area, and search/filter based on their needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Providing real-time updates and information on available shelters and food resources (e.g. what is currently open).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="indent"></p>
                <p>Eventually, we hope a fully-functional version of our application would also be used by employees of relevant service organizations, such as soup kitchens and homeless shelters. Future design goals for our application include:</p>
                <p class="indent"></p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Giving shelters and food banks a medium to disseminate information about their services, updates, and announcements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developing a simple interface so organizations can easily provide status information and updates in real-time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Our target user demographic greatly influenced our decision to design our prototype as a public, interactive, touch-screen display. Through our initial needfinding studies, we found that almost all our participants who were temporarily
                    displaced or homeless had access to technology and internet (through personal, shared, or public devices). However, we realized this is only a small sample of our target user base. For many others, access to technology and/or the internet
                    is a luxury they cannot afford.</p>
                <p class="indent"></p>
                <p>We chose to test our high fidelity prototype in Charlotte, North Carolina. Using the city as the test market for the prototype, we found that many food banks and shelters are located in and around the center-city, uptown neighborhoods.
                    Similarly in other larger cities, these resources and services are often clustered in metropolitan areas. Higher homeless populations are correlated in these densely-population urban areas: in North Carolina, the city of Charlotte
                    accounts for most of the state’s homelessness by population numbers and percentage of general population (source: National Alliance to End Homelessness). Ideally, our public display would be installed in a highly-populated metro area,
                    where: 1: it is easily accessible to large populations of displaced and homeless individuals, and 2: it is in close proximity to numerous shelter and food services. Keeping this in mind, additional design rationale breaks down as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Touch screens are fairly simple to operate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More accessible and more useful: providing a public display means users without personal/shared technology devices can still access our application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Information and updates can be set to roll and displayed automatically, so everyone using our application will simultaneously get real-time statuses and information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We initially considered three prototypes: website, kiosk, and public display. Of the three, the public display had the best visibility, usefulness, discoverability, and ease of use.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>With the goal feature in mind, we needed to understand how users could approach this feature. How would they interact differently on a desktop compared to a mobile device? We developed and used a primary persona: Jake, and two secondary
                        personas as tools for this process. A main takeaway from this was the minimum required pages we would need for our first prototype. </p>

                        <h2>Information & System Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Information architecture (IA) is all about organization of information in a clear and logical way. Such organization follows a clear purpose — helping users navigate complex sets of information. The challenge when building IA is
                            in understanding how your app or website actually works from the user’s perspective, and how to organize that information into a readable, legible format. There are two major requirements for actually constructing IA: organizing
                            it through a visual hierarchy (that is, a hierarchy of features, functions, and behavior) and creating a legend for displaying different types of features, interactions, and flows. In other words, the most important factors
                            to building your IA are where individual components of the architecture are placed (hierarchically), and how they’re labeled and displayed. We all know how important it is to produce content that users will find valuable, but
                            what’s equally important is to make that content findable. Time is the most precious resource people have. We live in a world where people expect to find a solution to their problems with the least amount of effort. When the
                            process of finding information is too complicated or too slow, there’s a risk that people will simply abandon it.

                        <p> Once we finished our third round of user tests, I moved on to skinning the prototype to give it a clean visual user interface. I made my choices for color pallet, flat buttons, and visual icons based on Patelco’s current branding
                            styles. I belived that keeping this style when working for a client is highly important: my job in redesign is not to rebrand my client, only to better communicate their website for their users to understand. </p>

                        <h2>Evaluation Methodology</h2>
                        <p>Evaluating rapid prototypes should employ quick and light-weight feedback methods, reflecting the low risk stage and stakes at this stage of the process, and focus primarily on getting rapid feedback from would-be users or participants
                            about a new idea. Based on the aforementioned principles, we tried to get as much Heuristic evaluation done while designing the prototype and decided to conduct a user study with the final design, using questionnaires and interviews.
                        </p>

                        <p>We had to take into account the fact that usability is not intrinsically objective in nature but is rather closely intertwined with an evaluator’s personal interpretation of the artefact and his or her interaction with it. We conducted
                            the user studies by first giving the participant background information about our motivation for this project. Next, we asked them to complete pre-defined tasks. Then, we gave them a paper (or have them enter it on a computer)
                            and had them answer the survey questions. At the end of the evaluation, we asked the participants a few open-ended questions out loud and noted their answers.

                        <h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
                        <p>In the survey, we had a total of 12 participants (8 males and 4 females). The result to each question was analyzed, and we include comments made by participants in the free response questions asked.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            We further analyzed the results of our participants using One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the female participants (Group 1) and the male participants (Group 2). Analysis
                            of Variance Results: F-statistic value = 0.08424 P-value = 0.77249

                        <h2>Modifications based on Evaluation Results</h2>
                        <p>While conducting the user studies, we uncovered a few modifications to make on the prototype and future work on the finished product. One minor improvement is increasing the font size of the search results. Some participants had
                            trouble reading it, and they mentioned that it may be more difficult to read on a large screen if someone was far away but still wanted to see what was going on. Participants also suggested that we provide better labeling of
                            the pages to make the purpose of the application a little more clear. For instance, one participant was confused by the wording “available now” on the main search screen next to each organization (food bank or shelter). They
                            thought it would be more clear to reword it to “open now.” They also said, “It is not very obvious what this display is all about. At first glance it just looks like a Google map search. Maybe a title or logo that lets people
                            know that this is a display for people needing shelter or food? Otherwise homeless people walking right by it might not ever use it if they don’t know what it is.” This same participant suggested that the number of markers
                            on the map should be consistent with the number of results on the side panel. This would be implemented as future work, since our prototype is not yet fully functional.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Many participants reported that they were unable to find the daily hours, as the days and times were not specified. They said they would prefer an expanded list, where each day is listed individually with its hours next to it. This would be another minor
                            modification to make in our prototype, which would enhance discoverability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Regarding the big screen implementation, a few participants reported that they would not feel comfortable using this on the big screen, due to privacy concerns. They suggested that there should also be a mobile app and/or website version of the application.
                            This would provide more privacy to users if they did not feel comfortable using it publicly. This would also make it more convenient for those who may not live or currently be near one of the big screens (so they could access
                            it anywhere).
