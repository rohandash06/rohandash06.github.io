                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Continental Tires needed to help users create dashboards more effectively & quickly. The old process required creating dashboards, and all the widgets within, completely from scratch. The team’s goal was creating a “one-click solution”
                    where the user could create a useful dashboard right away without any configuration.

                    <li>
                        Grant immediate access to project critical information. It wasn’t just about quality, it was about speed. We needed to streamline access to data.

                        Finish the project in 3 months. Starting in Sept. 2018, the launch for the pilot was set for early December, giving the team a compressed timeline to craft the right solution.

        <h2>Creating & Testing Mid-Fidelity Flows</h2>
        <p>Immediately following the whiteboard session, I used Adobe Creative Suite & Power BI to create mid-fidelity versions of the white board sketches. These mid-fi flows become the key to the intermediary stage of internal testing before hi-fi prototyping
            and testing with users.</p>
        <p>For initial, early-stage feedback, We showed the mid-fi user flows to 12 Users. We administered these casual tests individually, explaining the problem and collecting feedback on the proposed redesign for the dashboard creation process.. The informal
            testing also gave him a chance to answer his own personal questions and concerns. Ultimately, the tests proved successful: the absence of bad feedback is still good feedback.</p>

        <h1>High Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
        <p> Since the goal of creating a prototype is to test your design decisions, the first step was outlining desired insights in a usability testing plan.The usability testing plan also included sections such as the test script and a list of user tasks.
            This document prioritized test goals for the most important user actions: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>
                Validate that people know how to create a new dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Validate the 3 default testing templates are useful options (Project, Campaign, Team).
            </li>
            <li>
                Validate that created dashboards are discoverable from within the project.
            </li>
        </ul>

            </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Since the new design needed to be intuitive without confusing current users, I actually chose a left-handed tabbed format versus the multi-step process the team initially sketched. I realized the choice was simpler for his team to implement while
            also benefiting users. Designers wouldn’t need to create playful icons, developers wouldn’t need to build a multi-step wizard, and users could select their dashboard type faster with fewer steps.</p>

            <h1>Design highlights</h1>
            <p>The UI design was made to be easy on the eye, because Users would typically work with the Core Banking system for majority of their work day. Thus the design should be neutral. UI customization in the future was also made possible.The system
                supported multiple languages, locales, permissions and keyboard navigation (designed and tested). The web application was designed for desktop and large screens and had a responsive layout with two breakpoints: 1024 px and 1200 px.
            </p>
        </header>

        <h1>Usability Testing & Iteration</h1>
        <p>The team conducted remote, moderated usability tests with 24 people. I moderated the testing sessions, while another team member observed and took notes. We tested two main scenarios: creating a dashboard, and finding an existing dashboard in
            the project. Test results were quickly iterated into a new version, which was then likewise tested and the results reiterated, until the team came up with the proven, ideal design.

        </div>
        <p>Usability testing revealed the design worked well as a system:
        </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>
                Users found the tabbed layout easy to use and understand when creating dashboards from templates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users mentioned the default testing templates were useful and matched their needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                While most users found the default widgets useful, some mentioned how they’d prefer different widgets due to personal preferences. For example, some users didn’t find the “Remaining Work” linechart widget useful. Others wanted the ability to save their
                customizations to the templates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users did experience some difficulty in accessing a dashboard once created.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I spent considerable time with the program manager to map out the patterns of feedback to consolidate insights. To improve findability of newly-created dashboards, We decided to increase negative space around the “View Project Dashboard” label
            inside their details panel view. Further improvements, such as the ability to save widget edits, were earmarked for later testing, since they were fell outside the scope of the MVP.</p>

        <p>Following the Agile process, development sprints immediately followed the design sprints. Even as Our team was still testing prototypes, developers were already building the validated iterations.
